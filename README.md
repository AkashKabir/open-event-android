# Open Event Android

This is the apk branch of the The Open Event Android project, that holds a sample Android app that gets rendered on pull requests in the development branch and can be used to explore the features of the app and for testing.

The project has two components: 1. The **App Generator**, a web application that is hosted on a server and generates an event Android app from a zip with JSON and binary files and 2. A generic **Android app** - the output of the app generator. The mobile app can be installed on any Android device for browsing information about the event.

More information on the project on the Readme.md of the development branch.
